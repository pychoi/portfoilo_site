    <h3>I am a front end web developer.</h3>
    <p>
        Originally born in Hong Kong, I have called Minneapolis, Minnesota home for almost 20 years.
        Prior to web development, I was solving problems as an engineer in the medical device industry.
        My passion for marrying problem-solving and design have led me to front end web development.
        I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful design and experience.
        When I am not coding, you will find me cooking, lifting weights, or feeding/admiring my sourdough starter.</p>
